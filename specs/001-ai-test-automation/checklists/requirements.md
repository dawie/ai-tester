# Specification Quality Checklist: AI-Driven Playwright Test Automation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:
- All 3 user stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) and independently testable
- 12 functional requirements defined with clear MUST statements
- 7 measurable success criteria with specific metrics (percentages, time, coverage)
- Success criteria are user-focused (e.g., "users can generate test cases in under 3 minutes")
- Edge cases identified for error handling, dynamic content, rate limits, and UI changes
- Assumptions documented for API access, authentication, and scope boundaries
- No implementation details present - specification is technology-agnostic
- All acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` commands.
