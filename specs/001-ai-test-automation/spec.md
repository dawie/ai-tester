# Feature Specification: AI-Driven Playwright Test Automation

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-test-automation`  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Setup system using Docker with Playwright to analyze web applications, generate test cases with Google Computer Use API for human review, then execute approved tests and produce reports"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-28

- Q: How should the system handle Gemini API failures (rate limits, timeouts, service errors)? ‚Üí A: Fail immediately with clear error message and exit (no retry)
- Q: How should generated tests handle dynamic content and unstable selectors? ‚Üí A: Prioritize stable selectors (text content, roles, data-testid) with wait strategies, expect some test failures
- Q: How does the system identify which test files are approved for execution versus still in draft/review status? ‚Üí A: Use directory structure (tests/draft/ vs tests/approved/) to separate file states

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Automated Test Discovery (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

A QA engineer points the system at a web application URL. The system uses Google's Gemini Computer Use API to autonomously explore the application, capturing page states (HTML + screenshots), and generates a comprehensive set of Playwright test cases covering navigation, forms, buttons, and interactive elements.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - automated test generation eliminates manual test writing effort and discovers test scenarios engineers might miss.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a target URL and verifying that test case files are generated with valid Playwright Python syntax and saved to the tests directory. Delivers immediate value by producing reviewable test cases.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a target web application URL, **When** the system is invoked with that URL, **Then** the system captures page HTML and screenshots, sends context to Gemini API, and generates Python Playwright test cases saved to `tests/ai_generated_tests.py`
2. **Given** a multi-page web application, **When** test generation runs, **Then** the system explores multiple pages and generates test cases for each distinct page/flow
3. **Given** a page with forms, **When** test generation analyzes the page, **Then** generated tests include form field validation, submission, and error handling scenarios
4. **Given** an authentication-protected application, **When** test generation encounters login, **Then** the system generates authentication setup in test fixtures

### User Story 2 - Human Review & Approval (Priority: P2)

A QA engineer reviews the AI-generated test cases in their editor, makes necessary adjustments (correcting selectors, adding assertions, removing irrelevant tests), and marks them as approved for execution.

**Why this priority**: Essential quality gate - human expertise ensures tests are accurate, relevant, and aligned with business requirements before execution.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating sample test cases, manually editing them, and confirming the system can distinguish between draft and approved test files. No execution needed to validate this workflow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** AI-generated test cases in `tests/ai_generated_tests.py`, **When** a human reviews the file, **Then** the test code is readable, well-commented, and uses standard Playwright patterns
2. **Given** reviewed test cases, **When** the human saves changes, **Then** the system preserves edits without regenerating/overwriting
3. **Given** multiple test case files, **When** organizing tests, **Then** the system supports clear naming conventions and directory structure for different test suites

---

### User Story 3 - Test Execution & Reporting (Priority: P3)

A QA engineer triggers test execution. The system runs all approved Playwright tests in Docker containers, captures execution results (pass/fail/error), generates HTML/JUnit XML reports, and saves screenshots/traces for failed tests.

**Why this priority**: Completes the automation loop - verifies generated tests actually work and provides actionable feedback for debugging failures.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing pre-written Playwright tests (bypassing generation), executing them in Docker, and validating report generation with proper pass/fail metrics and failure artifacts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** approved test cases in `tests/` directory, **When** execution is triggered, **Then** all tests run in a Docker container with Playwright browsers installed
2. **Given** test execution completes, **When** viewing results, **Then** a JUnit XML report is generated in `reports/junit.xml` with test outcomes
3. **Given** a test failure occurs, **When** reviewing failure details, **Then** the system captures HTML snapshots, screenshots, and console logs in `captures/` directory
4. **Given** multiple test runs, **When** comparing results, **Then** reports include timestamps and unique identifiers for each test run

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the target web application is unreachable or returns errors?
- How are authentication cookies/sessions managed between test generation and execution phases?
- What happens when generated test selectors break due to UI changes between generation and execution?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST run entirely within Docker containers to ensure environment consistency across different machines
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept a target web application URL as input via command-line interface or configuration file
- **FR-003**: System MUST use Playwright to capture page HTML content and full-page screenshots for analysis
- **FR-004**: System MUST send captured page context (HTML + screenshot) to Google Gemini Computer Use API for test case generation
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate Python Playwright test cases using pytest framework and save them to `tests/` directory
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve human edits to generated test files and never overwrite approved tests
- **FR-007**: System MUST execute Playwright tests in headless mode by default within Docker containers
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate JUnit XML test reports in `reports/` directory for CI/CD integration
- **FR-009**: System MUST capture failure artifacts (HTML, screenshots, console logs) in `captures/` directory when tests fail
- **FR-010**: System MUST load Google API key from environment variables (`.env` file) and never hardcode credentials
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear console output with success (‚úÖ) and failure (‚ùå) indicators for each operation
- **FR-012**: System MUST support both headless and headed browser modes for debugging purposes
- **FR-013**: System MUST fail immediately with descriptive error message when Gemini API is unavailable, rate-limited, or returns errors (no retry attempts)
- **FR-014**: System MUST generate tests using stable selectors (text content, ARIA roles, data-testid attributes) and wait strategies to handle dynamic content

### Key Entities

- **Test Case**: A generated or human-edited Playwright test function covering specific UI interactions (navigation, form submission, button clicks, assertions)
- **Page Capture**: A snapshot consisting of HTML content + screenshot + metadata (URL, timestamp) used as context for AI analysis
- **Test Report**: Execution results including test outcomes (pass/fail/skip), duration, error messages, and links to failure artifacts
- **Test Run**: A single execution session identified by timestamp, encompassing all tests executed and their collective results

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can generate test cases for a 5-page web application in under 3 minutes (excluding API latency)
- **SC-002**: Generated test cases cover at least 80% of interactive UI elements visible on analyzed pages (buttons, links, forms)
- **SC-003**: 90% of generated test cases execute successfully without syntax errors or missing dependencies
- **SC-004**: Test execution reports include all standard metrics: total tests, passed, failed, skipped, duration, and failure reasons
- **SC-005**: Failure artifacts (screenshots, HTML snapshots) are captured for 100% of failed tests
- **SC-006**: System reduces manual test case writing time by at least 60% compared to writing tests from scratch
- **SC-007**: Human reviewers can understand and edit generated test cases without needing to consult documentation 85% of the time

## Assumptions

- Google Gemini Computer Use API access is available with sufficient quota for the expected volume of test generation requests
- Target web applications are publicly accessible or authentication credentials can be provided via environment variables
- Playwright's default selectors (text content, roles, labels) are sufficient for most element identification scenarios
- Docker Desktop is installed and configured on the user's machine (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Users have basic Python and pytest knowledge for reviewing and editing generated test cases
- Test execution will run on a single machine; distributed/parallel execution is out of scope
- Generated tests focus on functional UI testing; performance, security, and accessibility testing are out of scope for MVP
