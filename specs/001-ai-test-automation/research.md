# Research: AI-Driven Playwright Test Automation

**Feature**: 001-ai-test-automation  
**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

All technical decisions are well-defined in the feature specification and constitution. No major unknowns requiring research.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Decision: Python 3.11+ with Playwright
**Rationale**: 
- Constitution mandates Python with Playwright for UI automation
- Playwright provides stable selectors and wait strategies needed for dynamic content
- Python ecosystem has mature AI/ML libraries for Gemini API integration

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Selenium (rejected: less stable, more complex setup)
- Cypress (rejected: JavaScript-only, doesn't align with Python constitution)

### Decision: Google Gemini 2.5 Computer Use Preview API
**Rationale**:
- Specifically designed for computer vision and UI interaction analysis
- Can process both HTML and screenshot context for comprehensive test generation
- User explicitly requested Google Computer Use API

**Alternatives considered**: 
- OpenAI GPT-4 Vision (rejected: user specified Gemini)
- Local LLM (rejected: requires significant compute resources)

### Decision: Directory-based Test Approval (tests/draft/ vs tests/approved/)
**Rationale**:
- Simple file system approach, no additional tooling required
- Clear visual separation for human reviewers
- Aligns with standard development workflows

**Alternatives considered**:
- Metadata comments in files (rejected: parsing complexity)
- Separate tracking file (rejected: additional state management)

### Decision: Fail-Fast Error Handling
**Rationale**:
- Clarification session specified immediate failure on API errors
- Prevents silent failures and undefined states
- Supports CI/CD environments with time constraints

**Alternatives considered**:
- Retry with exponential backoff (rejected: user preference for fail-fast)
- Queue and wait indefinitely (rejected: blocks automation pipelines)

## Implementation Patterns

### Docker-First Development
- Use official Playwright Docker images as base
- Mount source code and outputs as volumes
- Environment variables for configuration

### Stable Selector Strategy
- Prioritize text content, ARIA roles, data-testid attributes
- Implement wait strategies for dynamic content
- Accept some test failures as part of robustness strategy

### AI Context Optimization
- Capture full-page screenshots for visual context
- Limit HTML content to prevent token overflow
- Include page metadata (URL, timestamp) for debugging

## Risk Mitigation

### API Rate Limiting
- **Risk**: Gemini API quota exhaustion
- **Mitigation**: Fail-fast with clear error messages, user can manage quota

### Dynamic Content Handling
- **Risk**: Generated selectors become stale
- **Mitigation**: Stable selector prioritization, accept expected failures

### Test Quality Assurance
- **Risk**: AI generates poor quality tests
- **Mitigation**: Human review workflow before execution

## Research Complete

All major technical decisions are resolved. Proceeding to Phase 1: Design & Contracts.
